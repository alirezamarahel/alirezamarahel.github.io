<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 98%;">This paper examines the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) as a potential tool to mitigate carbon leakage, with its design varying based on the inclusion of export subsidies and discrimination across trading partners. To this end, I adopt a quantitative multi-country, multi-industry trade model with climate externalities and abatement. I provide a novel theoretical decomposition of the welfare effects associated with carbon pricing in open economies, underscoring the incidence of the home country’s carbon tax on foreign residents as a vital welfare channel. The welfare decomposition reveals ambiguous welfare effects when export subsidies are incorporated in the CBAM, as they mitigate leakage but reduce the incidence of home’s carbon tax on foreign residents. The model is then mapped to data to evaluate these trade-offs quantitatively for the European Union. I found that non-discriminatory EU border adjustments lead to a Pareto improvement only if they exclude export subsidies, resulting in an 64.4% reduction in carbon leakage. On the other hand, discriminatory EU border adjustments are Pareto improving if they feature export subsidies in addition to import tariffs, resulting in reverse leakage and yielding a 76.8 million tonnes of global emission reduction outside the EU. These results provide a possible justification for the current design of the EU CBAM.</span>

<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 98%;">This paper investigates the time variation in the Captial Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) betas by introducing a new approach that models panel regressions with endogenous regime-switching using a latent autoregressive factor. For our estimation, we model the CAPM using portfolio returns sorted on book-to-market ratio, where the factor loadings, the pricing errors, and the volatility of the error terms can vary across high and low volatility states of the market. We find that the behavior of this asset pricing model significantly differs across different volatility regimes and its performance improves significantly, especially when it is evaluated during the times where the market is in the low volatility regime.</span>

<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 98%;">Domestic revenue mobilization has been a longstanding challenge for countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. Insufficient revenue has often constrained priority social and infrastructure spending, reducing countries’ ability to reach the Sustainable Development Goals, improve growth prospects, and address climate related challenges. Moreover, revenue shortfalls have often been compensated by large and sustained debt accumulatiosn, raising vulnerabilities in some countries, and limiting fiscal space to address future shocks. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have compounded challenges to sustainable public finances, underscoring the need for revenue mobilization efforts. The recent global crises have also exacerbated existing societal inequalities and highlighted the importance of raising revenues in an efficient and equitable manner. This paper examines the scope for additional tax revenue mobilization and discusses policies to gradually raise tax revenue while supporting resilient growth and inclusion in the Middle East and Central Asia. The paper’s main findings are that excluding hydrocarbon revenues, the region’s average tax intake lags those of other regions; the region’s fragile and conflict-affected states (FCS) face particular challenges in mobilizing tax revenue; In general, there is considerable scope to raise additional tax revenue; countries have made efforts to raise tax collection, but challenges remain; tax policy design, notably low tax rates and pervasive tax exemptions, is an important factor driving tax revenue shortfalls; weak tax compliance, reflecting both structural features and challenges in revenue administration, also plays a role; and personal income tax systems in the region vary in their progressivity—the extent to which the average tax rate increases with income—and in their ability to redistribute income. These findings provide insights for policy action to raise revenue while supporting resilient growth and inclusion. The paper’s analysis points to these priorities for the region to improve both efficiency and equity of tax systems: improving tax policy design to broaden the tax base and increase progressivity and redistributive capacity; strengthening revenue administration to improve compliance; and implementing structural reforms to incentivize tax compliance, formalization, and economic diversification.</span>

    How Tariﬀs Can Reshape the International Trade Flow: Evidence from Colombia
  </span>
</a>        
</summary>

<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 98%;">This paper argues that trade barriers such as tariffs can cause more harm than benefit, resulting in lower income, reduced employment, and lower economic output. While tariffs may afford short-term protection for domestic industries, they do so at the expense of other industries and consumers in the economy, resulting in less efficient allocation of resources and slower economic growth. The paper examines the short-run effects of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (CTPA) in 2012 on Colombia's economy, which aimed to eliminate tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods and services between the United States and Colombia. The paper analyzes the impact of the agreement on sectors such as metal and ores, infrastructure and machinery, transport equipment, autos and auto parts, building products, paper and paper products, and consumer goods. The paper concludes that the effects of tariffs depend on the incidence of tariffs, and consumers and firms who buy foreign products can gain from lower tariffs as the final price will be lower for them.</span>
