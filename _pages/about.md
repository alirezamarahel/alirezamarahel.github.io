I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Indiana University Bloomington. My research falls at the intersection of econometrics and finance. I apply a wide range of empirical methods, with a focus on using modified Markov regime switching to understand the behavior of asset pricing models in relation to macroeconomic uncertainties. In my current research, I create novel models to help understand how a positive feedback loop from the shocks to the market excess return can improve the prediction of stock exess returns.

I am on the 2023/2024 Job Market and will be available for interviews.
