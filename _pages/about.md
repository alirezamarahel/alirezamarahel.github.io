## About Me
I am **Alireza Marahel**, an Economics Ph.D. candidate at **Indiana University** in Bloomington, Indiana. I am set to defend my dissertation and graduate in the spring of 2024. My research revolves around quantitative economics, climate policy, financial econometrics, and machine learning, where I combine theoretical frameworks with the application of quantitative methods on large datasets. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills and experience in economic analysis and problem-solving in collaboration with others.
